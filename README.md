Dice game by Ms. Heard's class

Written with the help of Ms. Heard's 2:30 PM class on December 10, 2015. I'm certain any bugs in the code are entirely my fault. :)

## Messages for the class
So, programming is a pretty big subject, and there was a lot of stuff that I didn't get to cover, and there were also some very good questions that I didn't get to go into much depth about. I thought I'd go over a few extra things here.

### GitHub
Let's start with this: this `README.md` file is being displayed (probably!) on GitHub, which is a website where I post the majority of my personal projects. The company I work for also keeps their work on this website, so it's easy to see that it must be a pretty powerful tool. Think of it like... Facebook, but for open source hackers. :)

The reason this website is important is that it allows me not only to keep all the versions of a program together, but it allows me to keep the code for my programs in a place where, if my house floods or something, it won't be rusted to death on my hard drive. :p I also use GitHub to make it easier for me to edit the same code on different machines.

If you poke around this *repository* a little bit, you'll see that I have included several *branches* of the code we wrote in class. These branches each represent different versions of the code, each with different bugs or features. I'll go over that later.

### Licensing
This repository also contains a file called `LICENSE.md`. That's a very important file! If you don't see a license with someone else's code, you *can't legally use it.* If you do see a license, you may be able to use it subject to the terms of the license.

In this case, I have chosen (as I almost always do) the MIT license, which means--basically--that you can do anything you want with my code as long as you A) admit that I wrote it, and B) promise not to sue me.

You may also notice that I included you guys in the copyright notice!

### Possible enhancements
I thought I'd list some things you could do to the code:

- What if you wanted to do 5 rounds instead of 3? Or a million rounds, even? (A computer could still do that very quickly, even though it took you guys like a minute to do an entire game. :p)

- Maybe we could make it so that users can pick other than "Player One" and "Player Two"?

- How about the ability to use dice other than a standard 1-6 gaming die?

### Left as an exercise to the reader
Do you think you guys could rewrite the entire program in a totally different language? Actually, you could *totally* do it with a GUI this time. :D
